/**
 * Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i
 * Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1.
 * All elements may not be present in the array.
 * If the element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array.
 * Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.
 * <p>
 * Approach -
 * - iterate through each element of the array
 * - check if arr[i] == -1, if true, ignore it
 * - if arr[i] != -1, then check if arr[i] == i (element i at index i), if true, ignore it
 * - if arr[i] != -1 and arr[i] != i, then there is different element k at index i,
 * so place the element k at its correct index k
 *      - if arr[i] is vacate, means arr[i] = -1, then put arr[i] = i
 *      - if arr[i] is not vacate, means arr[i] = k, then temp = k, then arr[i] = i,
 * and now we have to place temp at its correct position index k
 * - this process is repeated till each element is correctly placed
 * <p>
 * Time complexity - O(n)
 * Auxiliary space - O(1)
