/**
 * Count the number of possible triangles
 * Given an unsorted array of positive integers,
 * find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles.
 * For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of the two values (or sides)
 * must be greater than the third value (or third side).
 *
 * Approach -
 *  - sort the array
 *  - take 3 variables - l = start, r = end, i = element starting from end of array
 *  - traverse the array from end(n-1) to 1
 *  - for each iteration, keep value of l = 0 and r = i-1
 *  - since array is sorted, if a triangle is formed with arr[l] and arr[r]
 *      then triangles can also be formed from a[l+1], a[l+2]â€¦..a[r-1], arr[r] and a[i]
 *      calculated using (r-l) then decrement r and continue till l < r
 *  - if a triangle is not formed with arr[l] and arr[r] then increment l and continue till l < r
 *  - hence, overall complexity of iterating through all array elements reduces
 *
 *  Time complexity - O(n^2)
 *  Auxiliary space - O(1)
