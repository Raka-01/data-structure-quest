/**
 * Count the number of possible triangles
 * Given an unsorted array of positive integers,
 * find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles.
 * For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of the two values (or sides)
 * must be greater than the third value (or third side).
 *<p>
 * Approach -
 *  - sort the array in asc order
 *  - run a nested loop, outer loop runs from start to end
 *      and inner one runs from index+1 of outer loop to end
 *      counter for outer loop - i
 *      counter for inner loop - j
 *  - take another variable k = i+2
 *  - two pointers i and j, where array[i] and array[j] represent two sides of the triangles
 *  - For a fixed i and j, find the count of third sides which will satisfy the conditions of a triangle
 *      i.e find the largest value of array[k] such that array[i] + array[j] > array[k]
 *  - when we get the largest value, then the count of the third side is k â€“ j, add it to the total count
 *<p>
 *  Time complexity - O(n^2)
 *      - it looks more because of 3 nested loops, but k is initialized only once in outermost loop
 *      - innermost loop executes at most O(n) time for every iteration of the outermost loop,
 *          because k starts from i+2 and goes up to n for all values of j
 *  Auxiliary space - O(1)
 *      - No extra space needed, so space complexity is constant
