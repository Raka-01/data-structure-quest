Topics(mostly algorithms) that I will study later after completing the overall data structure
    1. Searching algorithms ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/ )
        - Meta Binary Search | One-Sided Binary Search
        - Fibonacci Search
        - The Ubiquitous Binary Search
    2. Unimodal function
    3. Sorting algorithms  ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/ )
        - simple one of each of common sorting algos are done
        - recursive and modified ones are left
        - start from heap sort forward (0 implementation)
    4. Inversion Count Problem ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inversion-count-in-array-using-merge-sort/ )
    5. Divide & Conquer algorithm
    6. Generate power set & generate subsequences ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subarraysubstring-vs-subsequence-and-programs-to-generate-them/ )
    7. Lomuto partition Scheme ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hoares-vs-lomuto-partition-scheme-quicksort/ )
    8. (Hurdle-set) Sort an array which contain 1 to n values (needed cyclic sort) ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-array-contain-1-n-values/ )
