Topics(mostly algorithms) that I will study later after completing the overall data structure
    1. Searching algorithms ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/ )
        - Meta Binary Search | One-Sided Binary Search
        - Fibonacci Search
        - The Ubiquitous Binary Search
    2. Unimodal function
    3. Sorting algorithms  ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/ )
        - simple one of each of common sorting algos are done
        - recursive and modified ones are left
    4. Inversion Count Problem ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inversion-count-in-array-using-merge-sort/ )
